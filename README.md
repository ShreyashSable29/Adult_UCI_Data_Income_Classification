# Adult_UCI_Data_Income_Classification
The Repository contains the project of predicting weather the employee/person is having the salary greater than 50k (>50k) or not

Many binary classification tasks do not have an equal number of examples from each class, e.g. the class distribution is skewed or imbalanced.

A popular example is the adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below 50k.
This means that techniques for imbalanced classification can be used whilst model performance can still be reported using classification accuracy, as is used with balanced classification problems.

In this Project, we will discover how to develop and evaluate a model for the imbalanced adult income classification dataset.

After completing this tutorial, we will know:

- How to load and explore the dataset and generate ideas for data preparation and model selection.
- How to systematically evaluate a suite of machine learning models with a robust test harness.
- How to fit a final model and use it to predict class labels for specific cases.
